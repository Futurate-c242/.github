## Background
Selecting a career can be one of life’s most challenging decisions. People often feel overwhelmed when considering the numerous career paths they could potentially follow (Azhenov et al., 2023). Gati et al. (2012) defined career decision-making as the process people go through when searching for career alternatives, comparing them, and making a choice. Many students face uncertainty in choosing their career path despite their interests and skills.

Our team came up with this project after noticing that many students, like us, often feel worried and anxious when we have to choose our future career path from the numerous job choices available. This led us to try solving the question:
“How can students overcome the uncertainty of choosing a career suitable for them given the many job choices and their diverse skills?”

We felt there was a need for a tool that could provide personalized career recommendation based on each individual’s unique skills, thereby making the process of choosing a career easier and less stressful for students.

Several studies have addressed similar problems by developing recommendation models and personalized systems. However, these solutions typically focus on specific fields of study. Our application aims to expand beyond that, offering career recommendations that assist more students with diverse skills and backgrounds.

Our application will be able to offer personalized career recommendations based on each user’s unique skills and background. By analyzing the input provided, the app generates tailored career suggestions that align with the user’s strengths. If users feel that the initial recommendations don’t meet their expectations, they can easily request additional suggestions. This flexibility ensures that users have the opportunity to explore a variety of options and find a career path that truly resonates with their goals and potential. This app is a suitable tool for career exploration, helping students navigate their journey with confidence and clarity

## Philosophy
The logo is inspired by two symbols: a light bulb and a worker. The light bulb represents ideas, inspiration, and enlightenment, symbolizing how the application provides users with insights and “enlightenment” about career paths that align with their experiences and skills. Meanwhile, the worker icon embodies professionalism, roles, and individuality in the workplace, reflecting the app’s focus on guiding users toward careers that resonate with their unique qualities and aspirations.

## Results

## Future Plan
1. Refining Dataset and Feedback Loop
We will update the dataset with additional, more relevant local data through collaboration with various communities and local career platforms. Feedback from early users will be continuously gathered to improve the model's accuracy and relevance.

2. Prototype Optimization and Platform Expansion
We will enhance the prototype with personalization features such as filters based on location or skills, and develop applications for Android platforms and web browsers to ensure broader accessibility.

3. Basic Analytics and Collaboration
We will add basic analytics features to track usage patterns and utilize this data to improve functionality. Additionally, we will consider collaborating with campus career centers to promote the application as a job search solution for students.

4. Documentation and Incremental Development
Development documentation will be completed to support open-source collaboration, and additional features such as job application deadline reminders will be gradually implemented to enhance user experience.
